## Sample Code

If you are just trying to get started with our price feeds, see this self-contained code snippet [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-hack/tree/master). If you'd like to use more advanced oracle functions please see the further information below. You can find a full sample data feed consumer contract [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/Pragma/blob/master/contracts/starknet/src/sample_consumer/CheckEthThreshold.cairo) and the full Oracle interface specification is available [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/Pragma/blob/master/contracts/starknet/src/oracle/IEmpiricOracle.cairo).

```bash
%lang starknet

from starkware.cairo.common.pow import pow

from oracle.IPragmaOracle import IPragmaOracle, PragmaAggregationModes

const PRAGMA_ORACLE_ADDRESS = 0x446812bac98c08190dee8967180f4e3cdcd1db9373ca269904acb17f67f7093;

## Technical Specification

### Function: `get_spot_median`

This is the the simplest function that will aggregate all data into a median for a given spot pair ID.

#### Inputs

- `pair_id`: uppercased utf8-encoded string

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key based on the robust median algorithm. Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer

#### Function: `get_spot`

Similar to get_spot_median except it allows for an additional parameter to specify a custom aggregated logic (e.g. volume-weighted average (VWAP), mean and more).

#### Inputs

- `pair_id`: uppercased utf8-encoded string
- `aggregation_mode`: aggregation mode to use for combining the many data sources available in Pragma. Use constants defined in Pragma. Option must currently be set to `MEDIAN`. Additional options `VWAP`, `EXPONENTIAL_DECAY` and `MEAN` are coming soon.

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key based on the robust median algorithm. Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer

### Function: `get_spot_median_multi`

Similar to get_spot_median except it allows for getting multiple spot prices in one call.

#### Inputs

- `pair_ids_len`: number of pair IDs being requested
- `pair_ids`: pointer to the first uppercased utf8-encoded string in the array of pair IDs

#### Returns

- `prices_response_len`: number of responses returned
- `prices_response`: pointer to the first response, where each response is of type `PragmaPricesResponse` which consists of (`price`, `decimals`, `last_updated_timestamp`, `num_sources_aggregated`) with the same interpretation as on a `single get_spot_median` call (see above)

### Function: `get_spot_with_USD_hop`

This function enables you to rebase the price, i.e. use a different base currency. For instance, if you want the price of BTC/ETH, you can combine the BTC/USD and ETH/USD price data to derive that.

#### Inputs

- `base_currency_id`: uppercase utf8-encoded string for the base currency (e.g. BTC)
- `quote_currency_id`: uppercase utf8-encoded string for the base currency (e.g. ETH)
- `aggregation_mode`: aggregation mode to use for combining the many data sources available in Pragma. Use constants defined in Pragma. Option must currently be set to `MEDIAN`. Additional options `TWAP`, `EXPONENTIAL_DECAY` and `MEAN` are coming soon.

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key (using the algorithm specified by the `aggregation_mode` parameter). Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer

### Function: `get_spot_with_hops`

This function enables you to get the price of one currency in terms of another, by specifying the path from one the quote to the base currency. For instance, if you want the price of ETH/EUR, you can combine the ETH/USD, BTC/USD and BTC/EUR price data to derive that.

#### Inputs

- `currency_ids_len`: number of currency ids in the hops
- `currency_ids`: pointer to the first element in the list of currency IDs, where each currency ID is the utf8-encoded string for that currency (e.g. ETH)
- `aggregation_mode`: aggregation mode to use for combining the many data sources available in Pragma. Use constants defined in Pragma. Option must currently be set to `MEDIAN`. Additional options `TWAP`, `EXPONENTIAL_DECAY` and `MEAN` are coming soon.

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key (using the algorithm specified by the `aggregation_mode` parameter). Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer

### Function: `get_spot_for_sources`

This function enables you to get the price of one currency in terms of another, by specifying the path from one the quote to the base currency. For instance, if you want the price of ETH/EUR, you can combine the ETH/USD, BTC/USD and BTC/EUR price data to derive that.

#### Inputs

- `pair_id`: uppercased utf8-encoded string
- `aggregation_mode`: aggregation mode to use for combining the many data sources available in Pragma. Use constants defined in Pragma. Option must currently be set to `MEDIAN`. Additional options `TWAP`, `EXPONENTIAL_DECAY` and `MEAN` are coming soon.

- `sources`: pointer to the first source in the list of sources, where each source is a utf8-encoded string (e.g. "gemini")

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key (using the algorithm specified by the `aggregation_mode` parameter). Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer

### Function: `get_futures`

This function enables you to get the price of one currency in terms of another, by specifying the path from one the quote to the base currency. For instance, if you want the price of ETH/EUR, you can combine the ETH/USD, BTC/USD and BTC/EUR price data to derive that.
