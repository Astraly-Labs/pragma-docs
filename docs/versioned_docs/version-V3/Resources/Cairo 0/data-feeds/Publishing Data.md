Pragma makes publishing data easy because there is no off-chain infrastructure, so publishing only requires signing and timestamping data before sending it on-chain. All of this can be done with a simple, stateless node that costs a few dollars a month to run.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. Clone the Pragma [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/Pragma).

### 2. Install the dependencies ([see instructions](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/Pragma#setup)).

If you have trouble installing the fastecdsa dependency, try installing gmp with the command `brew install gmp` if you use Homebrew. For further troubleshooting, see this [thread](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22).

If you're having a `typeguard.type_check()` error, try installing the correct version of typeguard with `pip install typeguard==2.13.3`.

### 3. Generate your public-private key pair

Let's start by setting up some envirronement variables.

```sh
# Use Starknet testnet
export STARKNET_NETWORK=sepolia
# Set the default wallet implementation to be used by the CLI
export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
```

Now we can run the following commands:

```sh
# Make sure you have starknet 0.10.3 installed
starknet --version
# Generate a new account
starknet new_account --account <account_name>
```

You should then be able to find your public/private keys under `~/.starknet/accounts/starknet_open_zeppelin_accounts.json`

### 4. Deploy an account contract on Starknet

Next you will need to send some testnet/mainnet ETH on this account address in order to deploy the account.

**Feel free to ask us for some!**

Then simply run, replacing `<account_name>` with the name of your account.

```sh
# Deploying your account
starknet deploy_account --account <account_name>
```

### 5. Register your account contract address with Pragma

Currently, publisher registration is permissioned while we create a robust ecosystem of publishers that will enable the transition to being a completely open network. During that initial phase, publishers send their publisher ID (the felt-encoded uppercased string, e.g. `str_to_felt("GEMINI")=78362974965321`) and account contract address to the Pragma team. Publishers should also publish their account contract address/public key online so that third parties can verify their identity with them directly.

### 6. Set up the data fetching logic

To simplify the process of setting up a publisher, we provide an optional Docker base image and a Python SDK which can make it easier to get started. The process to integrate usually takes an hour to half a day.
The initial publishing frequency for the oracle is every 3 minutes on Starknet Sepolia testnet, we expect to move to single-digit seconds as the network matures and value secured grows.

#### Using the Pragma Python SDK

See a full sample script here, or copy paste the code below to get started. Note that you need to set environment variables `PUBLISHER`, `PUBLISHER_ADDRESS`, and `PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` before running the code. You can use the sample .env file here to set them (the file does not include `PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` for obvious reasons).
To make fetching data simple, implement your own fetching function using whatever libraries you want, as long as it returns a `List[SpotEntry]`.

```python
import asyncio
import logging
import os
import time
from typing import List

from empiric.core.entry import SpotEntry
from empiric.core.utils import currency_pair_to_pair_id, log_entry
from empiric.publisher.assets import EMPIRIC_ALL_ASSETS, EmpiricAsset
from empiric.publisher.client import EmpiricPublisherClient

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# you can fetch your data using any strategy or libraries you want

def fetch_entries(assets: List[EmpiricAsset], *args, **kwargs) -> List[SpotEntry]:
entries = []
for asset in assets:
    entries.append(
        SpotEntry(
        timestamp=int(time.time()),
        source="MY_SOURCE",
        publisher="MY_PUBLISHER",
        pair_id=currency_pair_to_pair_id("TEST", "USD"),
        price=10 * 10 ** asset["decimals"], # shifted 10 ** decimals
        volume=0,
        )
    )
return entries

async def publish_all(assets):
    publisher_private_key = int(os.environ.get("PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY"), 0)
    publisher_address = int(os.environ.get("PUBLISHER_ADDRESS"), 0)
    publisher_client = EmpiricPublisherClient(
        account_private_key=publisher_private_key,
        account_contract_address=publisher_address,
        network=os.environ['NETWORK'] # ENV var set to `testnet | mainnet`
    )

    # or use your own custom logic
    _entries = fetch_entries(assets)
    await publisher_client.publish_many(_entries)

    logger.info("Publishing the following entries:")
    for entry in _entries:
        log_entry(entry, logger=logger)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(publish_all(PRAGMA_ALL_ASSETS))

```

#### Docker Image

In this setup, a Python script would fetch data (your custom logic) and then use the Pragma SDK to publish that data, similar to the script above. In order to deploy you can use the pragma-publisher Docker base image. The base image is available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/astralylabs/pragma-publisher) and comes with the Python and all requirements (including the pragma-network Python package) installed.

Again, note the .env file in that same [folder](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/Pragma/tree/master/stagecoach/jobs/publishers/publish-all) which is passed to Docker at run time via the `--env-file` arg, with `PUBLISHER` and `PUBLISHER_ADDRESS` variables set, as well as a `PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` variable (which is not in the repository for obvious reasons).

Alternatively, you can find an example of how to use the SDK in a serverless deployment (e.g. AWS Lambda).

```bash
FROM astralylabs/empiric-publisher:1.4.16

COPY fetch-and-publish.py ./fetch-and-publish.py
CMD python fetch-and-publish.py
```
