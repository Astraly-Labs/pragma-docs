> Please be aware that the API is primarily intended for frontends and applications aiming to centrally utilize our top-tier data. This API will soon be (STARK)proven, paving the way for a diverse range of new decentralized applications. In the meantime, if you plan to utilize Pragma for your decentralized application, we highly recommend leveraging the Pragma decentralized oracle.
