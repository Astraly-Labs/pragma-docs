The Pragma team is constantly working to improve the network's robustness and functionality. Here are a few of the exciting things we are working on and plan to share with you soon. If you are interested in certain projects or have requests you don't see here, let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PragmaOracle).

## Native Data From The Most Liquid Markets

We are actively working on building out functionality to pull data (e.g. Uniswap TWAP, overnight rates, DEX liquidity data, etc.) directly from L1 to L2. There are a few different approaches we are considering, including L1 state-verification (storage proofs) on L2 and L1-L2 messaging.

## Off-Chain Computation

Today Pragma leverages the cheap computation available on StarkNet directly. We are working on using zk provers (e.g. PLONKY) to run those computations off-chain and bring the results & proof onto L2 for cheaper data without any additional trust assumptions.

## Further Audits

Pragma Network has already been audited by leading security research firm [Zellic](https://www.zellic.io/) (also audited Pyth, LayerZero, 1inch and many more), report to be released soon. Further audits are upcoming by partners such as Trail of Bits (who are auditing StarkNet as well).

## Expanding to New Data Verticals

Today, Pragma is reinventing data infrastructure for DeFi. But our mission is much broader: We are building the crucial decentralized infrastructure for all data, from the weather (parametric insurance) to sports (betting and fantasy sports) to news (prediction markets) and more. We believe in a world where societyâ€™s crucial applications are accessible to anyone, where transparency replaces backroom dealings and trustless software has made middlemen obsolete.
If you are building a protocol on a zk-rollup that needs real-world data that is not yet available on Pragma, let us know on Twitter. We are actively looking for development partners for weather, news and sports data.

## Permissionlessness

Today, the Pragma core team selects publishers, prioritizing the most liquid exchanges and biggest market makers. Working with these world-class partners is critical to guarantee data quality and reliability in the early days of the network.
Tomorrow, anyone who has high quality should be able to provide that data to the Pragma Network. We are actively working on leveraging programmable money and incentive systems to ensure that honest publishers are compensated fairly for their data while malicious actors are unable to corrupt the data feeds. We will have more updates on this soon.
